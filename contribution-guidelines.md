# Contribution Guidelines

To contribute to the repository, you may do so through Github website or by cloning the repository 
to your computer, making the necessary changes. Then creating a pull request on the repository 
for those changes to be merged in to the main branch. Admins will review the PRs and approve or
reject and provide feedback.

## File Names

The name of the file should reflect the contents of the file. Contributions that have filenames
such as "image001.jpg", "scan2.pdf", "untitled.png" or similar, will not be approved as it is 
unknown what that content is.

## Replace Spaces in File and Folder Names

We ask that you replace spaces in file names with underscores (_) or hyphens(-). All members of 
the group are not using Windows operating system. As a result, file and folder names that 
contain spaces can cause issues with users of other systems.

## Pull Request Titie

Pull request title should be conscise, but descriptive to know what is included in the request. 

Example of PR titles

* Bad title ```added files```
* Good title ```added sql files for grouping by column```

## Markdown

For text only items, we ask that you type them in Markdown format. If you are not familiar 
with Markdown, then we ask you see this
[Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet) so that your files 
are properly displayed in this repository.

## What if my content fits more than one category?

We ask that you include it in the most appropriate category. 

For example, a script that allows you to run a SQL command to export data to a spreadsheet, 
would be better suited for the SQL category instead of the Excel category.
